This is a BibTeX file with all IR (and related) sources that I've used in LaTeX projects thusfar. Emphasis is on international institutions, conflict management, and civil war. It is a fairly small list list at the moment, but it is growing rapidly. Disclaimer: there are most likely a few inaccuracies, I recommend double-checking. If you find anything incorrect, please let me know at dbowden88@gmail.com.
